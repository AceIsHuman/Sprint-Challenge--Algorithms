#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) I first thought this to be a polynomial time complexity, but I believe it is linear; O(n). This is because the while loop utilizes (a < n^3), but inside the loop a increases by (a + n^2).


b) This code snippet is a linearithmic, O(n log n), time complexity. This is because we have a loop that iterates `n` times, with a nested loop that has an logarithmic O(log n) time complexity.


c) `bunnyEars` has a linear O(n) time complexity since it will recursivley call itself `n` times.
